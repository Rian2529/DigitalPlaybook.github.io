        <h1>Introduction in Psycho-Social Perspectives<br><span>in Education [GED 107] Course</h1>
        <p class="par">There is an overwhelming demand to understand student and teacher 
            <br> experience during the period of recovery from the pandemic. Based on an OECD (2021) report, 
            <br> “Students" social and emotional skills are strong predictors of school grades across students’ 
            <br> background, age cohorts, and cities. Additionally, evidence also suggests that the relationship between 
            <br> social and emotional skills and school performance is nuanced- some skills are essentially uncorrelated 
            <br> with school performance but other skills, most notably persistence and curiosity, are strongly 
            <br> related to higher school performance for both 10- and 15-year-olds.” 
            <br>
            <br>
            There is a concrete need to help our learners and teachers to develop crucial life skills anchored on the following 
            <br>(a) Life Learnings
            <br>(b) Growth Mindset
            <br>(c) Socio-emotional Learning principles
            <br>(d) Tenets of the Whole Child
            <br>(e) PERMA Model of Wellbeing
            <br>
            <br>
            Moreover, an attempt to respond to the concrete need is the development of curated materials and 
            <br>activities in the form of a digital playbook. In sports, a playbook contains descriptions of all the plays 
            <br>and strategies used by a team, often accompanied by diagrams, issued to players for them to study and memorize 
            <br>before the season begins (dictionary.com)
            <br>
            <br>
            As a terminal requirement in GED 107, students enrolled in this course would have to develop a digital playbook 
            <br>that will help learners, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders in the attainment of learners maximum 
            <br>social-emotional potential.
