            <p>There is an overwhelming demand to understand student and teacher experience during the period of recovery from the pandemic. Based on an OECD (2021) report, “Students’ social and emotional skills are strong predictors of school grades across students’ background, age cohorts, and cities. Additionally, evidence also suggests that the relationship between social and emotional skills and school performance is nuanced- some skills are essentially uncorrelated with school performance but other skills, most notably persistence and curiosity, are strongly related to higher school performance for both 10- and 15-year-olds.” 

                There is a concrete need to help our learners and teachers to develop crucial life skills anchored on the following 
                <br><br>A. Life Learnings
                <br>B. Growth Mindset
                <br>C. Socio-emotional Learning principles
                <br>D. Tenets of the Whole Child
                <br>E. PERMA Model of Wellbeing
                
                <br><br>Moreover, an attempt to respond to the concrete need is the development of curated materials and activities in the form of a digital playbook. In sports, a playbook contains descriptions of all the plays and strategies used by a team, often accompanied by diagrams, issued to players for them to study and memorize before the season begins.
                
                As a terminal requirement in GED 107, students enrolled in this course would have to develop a digital playbook that will help learners, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders in the attainment of learners maximum social-emotional potential.
